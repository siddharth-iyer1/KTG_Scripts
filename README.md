# KTG_Scripts
### Collection of algorithmic trading and related projects from KTG Summer '22

#### Descriptions of Directories and Programs:

##### Siddharth's Big Alert Script:
  ###### Class that contains all my alerts, sent out to traders at the office.
    Currently includes:
      New 12 Month Highs
      New 12 Month Lows
      High Volume
      Stock Day Gap Status

  ##### 12 Month HL Trading Scripts:
    Contains 12 Month Highs and 12 Month Lows scripts used exclusively for forward testing without alerts.
    
  ##### Alert Scripts:
    Contains individual alert scripts. Alerts are kepts here until they are validated. 
    Then moved to Siddharth's Big Alert Script
    
  ##### Backtest Programs:
    This contains any trading scripts used for optimizing strategies. These will often have multiple
    versions of the same script with small strategy modifications.
    The optimized versions of these will be put into their respective "Trading Scripts" folders.
  
  ##### Other Projects:
    Random other stuff I work on. Typically not-so-great strategy ideas.
